## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Grid SASS

### What I learned

I used grid to make a responsive layout with less media queries. To acomplish this I emply auto-fit and minmax properties on repeat().
The result is a layout that decreases with the screen width with minimun use of media queries.
